  collapsed_text: To enhance the performance of an organic solar cell, it is essential to investigate the microscopic features that affect the charge mobility in semiconducting materials. The co-polymer indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole (C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT) has shown promising results for high mobility hole transfer. This research attempts to integrate the microscopic dynamics of this co-polymer onto the macroscopic simulation program ToFeT. The Time-of-Flight and field-effect transistor mobility measurements methods and their implementation in the simulation code are described. Subsequently, a network of inter and intramolecular interactions is built, and the morphology of C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT is extracted from a molecular dynamics simulation in Gromacs. The resulting mobilities are compared with transient SCLC and FET experimental data from literature. The time-of-flight mobilities show similar behaviour with experimental transient SCLC mobilities. The electric field dependence can be explained by charges getting stuck at the end of chains with a higher field. The simulated mobility values are slightly higher than the experimental transient SCLC mobilities. This can be explained by the lack of implementing a transfer integral decay on the intermolecular separation distance. The field-effect-transistor simulation was unsuccessful and are not implemented in this report. In further research, more pair-wise interactions of a C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT molecular dynamics simulation should be investigated. This additional data could be used to fit functions to vary the J-coupling. In conclusion, it is possible to simulate the charge mobility for long polymeric semiconductors using the Kinetic Monte Carlo ToFeT code.

  collapsed_text: Due to the ever-increasing demand for more efficient data storage, research into innovative ways of storage growing. To store data at the molecular level, rotating linkers of the UiO-66 metal-organic framework are investigated. Before we can control this rotation, the rotational dynamics of the 1,4-dicarboxylic linker will be researched. Two UiO-66 metal-organic frameworks functionalized with a polar -NH<sub>2</sub> and-NO<sub>2</sub> group respectively and a non-functionalized UiO-66 were synthesized. With the characterization techniques PXRD, DRIFTS, TGA and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption, it was concluded that the structure and surface area is the same as reported materials. There is water in all UiO-66 variants and DMF in UiO-66 and UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the dielectric properties were measured with Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy. This showed that the temperature-dependent behaviour of the relaxation peak is at lower temperatures for UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> than UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>. In addition, we compared UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> with another MOF with the same BDC linker, MIL-53-NO<sub>2</sub>, and it showed that the dielectric relaxation is around the same temperature. This suggests that the interaction of the linker and the framework are of equal magnitude. Furthermore, Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements showed no difference in heatflow for a stationary and a rotating linker. In conclusion, UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> has a similar interframework interaction as MIL-53-NO<sub>2</sub>. The large difference between relaxation temperatures for UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> and UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> may be explained by the interactions between the cornerstone and the linker which can hinder the rotation.
