  collapsed_text: With a background in chemical engineering, I am interested in the world of polymers and soft matter. I took courses in ‘<b>Functional Coatings</b>’ and ‘<b>Self-healing Materials</b>’ to become an expert in incorporating chemistry in modern material science. In addition, the minor ‘Sustainable Energy and Technology’ and the MSc course ‘<b>Materials for Clean Energy Technology</b>‘ have taught me a lot about the world-wide drive of creating renewable energy and products. With my knowledge in chemical material sciences, I would like to be part of the global sustainability trend. Lastly, the course ‘<b>Polymer Science</b>’ has taught me that unconventional materials such as polymers are complex to model. Because of that, the multiple courses on <b>Computational Materials Science</b> are an essential aspect to my specialisation.

  collapse_name: Simulating the charge mobility of C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT
  awards:
    - award: Simulating the charge mobility transfer of the copolymer C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT with Kinetic Monte Carlo

  collapsed_text: <i>To enhance the performance of <b>organic solar cells</b>, it is essential to investigate the microscopic features that affect the charge mobility in semiconducting materials. The co-polymer indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole (C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT) has shown promising results for high mobility hole transfer. This research attempts to integrate the <b>microscopic dynamics</b> of this co-polymer onto the <b>macroscopic simulation program ToFeT</b>. The Time-of-Flight and field-effect transistor mobility measurements methods and their implementation in the simulation code are described. Subsequently, a <b>network of inter and intramolecular interactions</b> is built, and the morphology of C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT is extracted from a molecular dynamics simulation in Gromacs. The resulting hole mobilities are compared with transient SCLC and FET experimental data from literature. The time-of-flight mobilities show similar behaviour with experimental transient SCLC mobilities.</i><br>

   From this 3 month internship, I have learned to work in an interdisciplinairy team. With limited prior knowledge of C, I managed to understand and use a complicated Kinetic Monte Carlo program and adapt it to my own research. Furthermore, I worked with <b>Python, bash and a cluster computernetwork</b>. The report was graded by Delft University of Technology and received a mark of <b>9.0/10</b>.<br>

    - award: BSc thesis project &mdash; Study of UiO-66 linkers' rotational dynamics
    - award: Minor &mdash; Sustainable Energy & Technology
    - award: Major &mdash; Chemical Technology

  collapsed_text: <i>Due to the ever-increasing demand for efficient data storage, innovative ways of <b>storing data on the molecular level</b> is being investigated. To store data on the molecular level, rotating linkers of the <b>UiO-66 metal-organic framework</b> (MOF) are a possible candidate. Before we can control this rotation, the <b>rotational dynamics</b> of the 1,4-dicarboxylic linker are being researched. With the characterization techniques PXRD, DRIFTS, TGA and N<sub>2</sub>-adsorption, it was concluded that the structure and surface area is the same as reported materials. WIth broadband dielectric spectroscopy, the rotational dynamics of the metal-organic frameworks was examined. In addition, we compared UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> with another MOF with the same BDC linker, MIL-53-NO<sub>2</sub>, and it showed that the dielectric relaxation is around the same temperature. This suggests that the interaction of the linker and the framework is of equal magnitude. In conclusion, UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> has a similar interframework interaction as MIL-53-NO<sub>2</sub>. The large difference between relaxation temperatures for UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> and UiO-66-NO<sub>2</sub> may be explained by the <b>interactions between the cornerstone and the linker</b> which can hinder the rotation.</i><br>

   During my bachelors thesis, I have gained <b>hands-on experience in a chemical lab</b> and can therefore work independently, safe and efficient.
