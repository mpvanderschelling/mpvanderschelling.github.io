  collapsed_text: To enhance the performance of an organic solar cell, it is essential to investigate the microscopic features that affect the charge mobility in semiconducting materials. The co-polymer indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole (C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT) has shown promising results for high mobility hole transfer. This research attempts to integrate the microscopic dynamics of this co-polymer onto the macroscopic simulation program ToFeT. The Time-of-Flight and field-effect transistor mobility measurements methods and their implementation in the simulation code are described. Subsequently, a network of inter and intramolecular interactions is built, and the morphology of C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT is extracted from a molecular dynamics simulation in Gromacs. The resulting mobilities are compared with transient SCLC and FET experimental data from literature. The time-of-flight mobilities show similar behaviour with experimental transient SCLC mobilities. The electric field dependence can be explained by charges getting stuck at the end of chains with a higher field. The simulated mobility values are slightly higher than the experimental transient SCLC mobilities. This can be explained by the lack of implementing a transfer integral decay on the intermolecular separation distance. The field-effect-transistor simulation was unsuccessful and are not implemented in this report. In further research, more pair-wise interactions of a C<sub>16</sub>-IDTBT molecular dynamics simulation should be investigated. This additional data could be used to fit functions to vary the J-coupling. In conclusion, it is possible to simulate the charge mobility for long polymeric semiconductors using the Kinetic Monte Carlo ToFeT code.
